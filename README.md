> **Data Science Salaries Classification 2023**

This project aims to analyse and classify the salaries of data science professionals using the ‘Data Science Salaries’ dataset retrieved from Kaggle. Using an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modelling approach, this project provides in-depth insights into salary trends based on various factors, such as experience level, job title, location, and company type. I'm using The dataset from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023

The data science industry continues to grow and is one of the most sought-after fields for many professionals. Understanding the salary structure in this field is crucial to help prospective employees and employers make informed salary and career decisions. The dataset used covers information from 2023 and provides a comprehensive overview of salaries across different positions and working conditions.

Analysis Objectives :
   1) Identified the regions with the highest number of orders.
   2) Analysed the frequency distribution of salaries by job category.
   3) Determined the most profitable job categories and sub-categories.
   4) Calculated the percentage of salaries by job category.
   5) Found the most frequently listed job titles that have the highest salaries.
   6) Analysed the categories and sub-categories that are at a disadvantage in terms of salary.

Key Insights :
